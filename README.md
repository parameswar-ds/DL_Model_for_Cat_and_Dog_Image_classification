Author: Parameswara rao

Date: 5 April 2020

I implimented model by using git push cat-dog(https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog) data set to classify images betwen dog and cat. This project is organised as follows:

(a)extract data from data set.
(b)preprocess the data and split into train and test data for given model.
(c)impliment 2D CNN model.
(d)use techniques to avoid overfitting.
(e)evaluate model using test data.

cat-and-dod:https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog: data set for given model.

Result:
test_loss: 0.3509
test_acc: 0.8730
